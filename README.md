# hearthguard
A pixel art survivorslike following the Udemy course "Create a Complete 2D Survivors Style Game in Godot 4". Follows the fabled Hearthguard as they are dropped into the fray, slaughtering swarms of Sipids. 
Custom art and effects by me.(At least in the future, for now, using a gorgeous tilemap from Kenney (https://www.kenney.nl/assets/tiny-dungeon).
