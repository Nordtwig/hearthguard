# hearthguard
A pixel art survivorslike following the Udemy course "Create a Complete 2D Survivors Style Game in Godot 4". Follows the fabled Hearthguard as they are dropped into the fray, slaughtering swarms of Sipids. 
For now, using a gorgeous tilemap from Kenney (https://www.kenney.nl/assets/tiny-dungeon).

The course is completed and the game is more or less finished. 
There's certainly tons left to do content-wise and balance-wise, but all the mechanics and features are there.
You'll find this version of the game made available under Releases.
